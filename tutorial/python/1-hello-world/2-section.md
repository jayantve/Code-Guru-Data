The Code
Python
# This is a simple Python script to greet the world
print("Hello, World!")
Why this works
print(): This is a built-in function that sends data to the standard output (usually your screen).

"Hello, World!": This is a string. In Python, strings are enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes (").

No Semicolons: Unlike many other languages, Python uses new lines to separate statements, so you don't need a ; at the end.

How to run it
Install Python: Ensure you have Python installed (check by typing python --version in your terminal).

Save the file: Copy the code above into a text editor and save it as hello.py.

Execute: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

Bash
python hello.py
