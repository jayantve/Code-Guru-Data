* Programming languages: JavaScript (Node.js), Python, Java, PHP
* Frameworks: Express, Django, Flask, Spring
* APIs (REST, GraphQL)
* Authentication and authorization

### 3. Full-Stack Development

Full-stack developers work on both frontend and backend parts of a web application.

* End-to-end application development
* Database design and management
* Deployment and maintenance
